# UX (User experience)

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to provide information about well known altrenative rock band Linkin Park. The website has to be attractive

# Design Choices:
The theme of this project is a Linkin Park fans website. Knowing that this is alternative rock band colour scheme was picked to create 
better atmosphere which suits band itself.

### Fonts:
My first choice of font was <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Martel+Sans&selection.family=Lato">Martel+Sans</a> because it looks
tidy and neat but also has soft edges to make text look not too heavy for a reader.

### Icons:
The icons used as social links in footer section. They are all known social website's icons. I used 'font-awesome' 'Facebook', 'Instagram', 'Twitter'
and 'Youtube' icons. I had to make sure they were reasonable size to be seen on a smaller devices too.

### Colours:
* #fff (White)
* #1E90FF (Dodgerblue)
* #0000CD (Medium blue)
* #F5F5F5 (White smoke)
* #F08080 (Lightcoral)
* #DCDCDC (Gainsboro)
* #000 (Black)

### Styling:

### Images + Background:
The background image I chose to on the banner I found via google search typing bands name but link to it can be found in Credts section.
More images can be found in About Us section of website and they are member's pictures for new and current band fans to recognise them in media.

I found images on random websites via google search.

# Wireframes:
I built wireframes for this project using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> mockups. I created basic wireframes for Mobile/Tablet/Desktop
on Balsamiq to show how structurally elements would appear on the page for different devices.
